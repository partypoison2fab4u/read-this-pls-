BYI
- I'm open to vent to but I don't know how to respond most of the time, I say what I can, but most of the time my way of comforting is cuddling/kissing/nuzzling.
- I LOVE talking to people in fandoms I'm in when I'm not on dniuf/dniuid.
- If I'm on dniuf and I crown you, you CAN respond !!
- Beware, I don't know what to say in conversations a lot of times, so if it's awkward my apologies... </3
- If I make you uncomfortable please tell me !!
- If you send me a whisper and I don't respond, it's most likely because I'm offtab or afk, but I will respond eventually !!
- Yes, I love Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss, but I DO NOT SUPPORT VIV.
- I do use pet names like sugar often, PLEASE let me know if you don't want me to, I will stop.
- I'm very forgetful so if I forget your name, I will ask for your name and pronouns so I can make a friend note. ^^
